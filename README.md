# SUMMARY

### JS_ARRAY_METHODS
Javascript array is a data structure that can hold more than one value. Here is a summary of the key points:

- Array Length:

The length property returns the size of an array.
- Array toString():

The toString() method converts an array to a string of comma-separated values.
- Array pop():

The pop() method removes the last element from an array.
- Array push():

The push() method adds a new element to the end of an array.
- Array shift():

The shift() method removes the first element from an array and shifts other elements to a lower index.
- Array unshift():

The unshift() method adds a new element to the beginning of an array and shifts older elements.
- Array join():

The join() method joins all array elements into a string with an optional separator.
- Array delete():

The delete operator can be used to delete array elements, but it leaves undefined holes.
- Array concat():

The concat() method creates a new array by merging existing arrays.
- Array flat():

The flat() method reduces array dimensionality by concatenating sub-array elements to a specified depth.
- Array splice():

The splice() method adds or removes items from an array at a specified position.
- Array slice():

The slice() method creates a new array by extracting a portion of an existing array.
- Automatic toString():

JavaScript automatically converts an array to a comma-separated string when a primitive value is expected.
- Finding Max and Min Values:

The tutorial mentions that there are no built-in functions for finding the highest or lowest value in a JavaScript array, and this will be covered in the next chapter.
The content covers various array manipulation methods, their usage, and examples in JavaScript.

### JS-FUNCTION
- Function Definition:

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
It is executed when invoked or called by an event, JavaScript code, or automatically (self-invoked).
- Function Syntax:

Defined using the function keyword, followed by a name and parentheses.
Function names follow variable naming rules.
*Parameters* (inputs) are listed inside the parentheses, and the code to be executed is enclosed in curly brackets.
- Function Invocation:

Functions are executed when called by an event, JavaScript code, or automatically.
The content hints at learning more about function invocation later in the tutorial.
- Function Return:

When a *return* statement is encountered, the function stops executing.
The return value is sent back to the caller, allowing computation and reuse of results.
- Benefits of Functions:

Functions enable code reuse and writing modular, reusable code.
The same code can be used with different arguments to produce different results.
- The () Operator:

Invokes (calls) the function, passing arguments if needed.
Examples demonstrate correct and incorrect usage.
Functions Used as Variable Values:

Functions can be used directly as variable values in expressions and assignments.
- Local Variables:

Variables declared within a function are local to that function.
They can only be accessed within the function, allowing the use of the same variable names in different functions.
Local variables are created when the function starts and are deleted when the function completes.
- The content emphasizes the versatility and utility of functions in JavaScript, introducing syntax, invocation, return values, and local variables. It also provides examples to illustrate these concepts.
